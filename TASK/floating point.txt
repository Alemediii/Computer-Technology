Good morning, in this presentation we will see number representation thgough
floating point.

We will se an ilustrative example for this case:

Whenever we have to represent the radius of a planet, we will need
a completely different number than the one we need to represent the weight of an atom

At first, why we will need a different representation way?
Well, some problems come up whenever is time to represent the atoms
WHERE IS THE ZERO POS, HOW CAN WE REPRESENT NEGATIVE EXPONENTS ETC

That's also why we implemented scientific notation in maths, in which we find 
the mantissa, the base and the exponent. The way with which we are related to 
these type of numbers makes me unnecessary to explain how do these work, 
but just in case, these are just aproximations, which make easier to do maths and 
express magnitudes without having to say any extra information

But we are in computer technology, so we should look for a bit by bit type of 
representation, with which we can introduce to memory, debugging and convention world,
so there is another way of representing these numbers

Apart from having some standards for the scientific notation, we also have these for:

- how many bits are represented for the exponent
- how many bits are represented for the mantissa

We also need through normalization, whats the standard for it, so we have some examples
What can we observe in these? These represent the same number, this is what we know by normalization
And each exercise should stablish what kind of normalization is used to each number, for example
a comma behind the ms 1, a comma after the last zero and that type of things
